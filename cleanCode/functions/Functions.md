#Functions

A brief overview of how you should write functions:

- Functions should only perform one function, a function should only relay one piece of information.
- A function should call nested function if another piece of functionality is needed to complete work.
- Functions indentation levels should not be greater than one as it will then be refactoring to many nested pieces of functionality.
- Use descriptive names over comments.
- Pass in as few arguments as possible, if needed rather encapsulate these arguments into an object.
  that will reduce cognitive load on the reader and increase maintainability of the function moving forward. 
- A function should not have any side effects.
- Functions should either do something or answer something but never both.
